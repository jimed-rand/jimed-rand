### Glad to see you here!  
Great to see you! I'm James "Jim" Ed Randson. A part-time Linux developer, co-founder and CEO of BocchiTheBox (obsolete), Package Maintainer for Runa Inoue SUSE Repository and runa-aur (coming soon), Graphics Designer, Former Web Developer, Student at [Indonesia Open University](https://ut.ac.id) at Undergraduate Information Systems Study Program, and a part-time novelist.

I'm also expert at computing, especially Linux operating systems and FOSS. And I'm fall in love with [openSUSE Project](https://www.opensuse.org/) because I like [openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/) which is rolling releases powered with [RPM (Red Hat Package Manager)](https://rpm.org/), [zypper](https://github.com/openSUSE/zypper), and [YaST](https://yast.opensuse.org/). I maintain [Runa Inoue's third-party repository for openSUSE Tumbleweed users](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:runa-chin). Besides that, I have more interesting in [Ubuntu LTS](https://releases.ubuntu.com/), [Fedora Labs](https://labs.fedoraproject.org/), [Debian Sid](https://www.debian.org/releases/sid/), [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org), [Artix Linux](https://artixlinux.org), and more.

And, I also speaks majority two language, such as Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian) and English (Sometimes badly American or fluently Australian) and minority such as Japanese, Russian, German, Italian, Korean, and Spanish (too bad for my Mexican Spanish). So, feel free to communicate with me using English or another language I'd learn it, whatever majority or minority. 

When you need me, you can contact me via [my campus mail (only for education purposes or student of Indonesia Open University)](mailto:053476233@ecampus.ut.ac.id), [my Google mailing, it's for everyone](mailto:jimmyedrandson@gmail.com), [my Disroot mailing, it's for everyone and fediverse enthusiasm)](mailto:jimedrand@disroot.org), or [my Microsoft mailing, it's for developers only](mailto:jimedrand@outlook.com) For now, I'm only accept mail for public communications or you can make a comment on RISR homepage for report packages problem or making discussions (make sure you had SUSE account to access it).
