### Glad to see you here!  
Good to see you! I'm James "Jim" Ed Randson. I'm a part-time Linux developer who works with Python and GTK. I also started Everything with Jim, I maintain the Runa Inoue SUSE Repository and runa-aur (coming soon), and I'm a graphics designer. In the past, I was a web developer and I currently study at [Indonesia Open University](https://ut.ac.id), where I'm enrolled in the undergraduate Information Systems Study Program. I'm also a part-time contributor at the [Pacstall Repo](https://github.com/pacstall/pacstall-programs).

I'm also expert at computing, especially Linux operating systems and FOSS. And I'm fall in love with [openSUSE Project](https://www.opensuse.org/) because I like [openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/) which is rolling releases powered with [RPM (Red Hat Package Manager)](https://rpm.org/), [zypper](https://github.com/openSUSE/zypper), and [YaST](https://yast.opensuse.org/). I maintain [Runa Inoue's third-party repository for openSUSE Tumbleweed users](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:runa-chin). Besides that, I have more interesting in [Ubuntu LTS](https://releases.ubuntu.com/), [Fedora Labs](https://labs.fedoraproject.org/), [Debian Sid](https://www.debian.org/releases/sid/), [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org), [Artix Linux](https://artixlinux.org), and more.

I speak Indonesian, English, and a few other languages, including Japanese, Russian, German, Italian, Korean, and Spanish. I'm more proficient in English, but I'm learning Japanese. I'm open to communicating in English or any other language you think I should learn. 

When you need me, you can contact me via [my campus mail (only for education purposes or student of Indonesia Open University)](mailto:053476233@ecampus.ut.ac.id), [my Google mailing, it's for everyone](mailto:jimmyedrandson@gmail.com), [my Disroot mailing, it's for everyone and fediverse enthusiasm](mailto:jimedrand@disroot.org), or [my Microsoft mailing, it's for developers only](mailto:jimedrand@outlook.com). For now, I'm only accept mail for public communications or you can make a comment on RISR homepage for report packages problem or making discussions (make sure you had SUSE account to access it).
